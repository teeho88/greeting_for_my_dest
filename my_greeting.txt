Happy Wednesday! Love you <3
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.
Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.
To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.
I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.
Love is not finding someone to live with. It's finding someone you can't live without.
