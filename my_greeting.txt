This is your Monday morning reminder that you are capable, strong, and ready to handle whatever this week throws at you.
Starting the week is easier knowing I have you. Go shine bright today!
Wake up with determination, go to bed with satisfaction. Have a productive and successful Monday!
I wish I could wrap you in my arms and keep the Monday stress away. Just remember, no matter how busy today gets, my heart is beating just for you.
Stop being so beautiful! You're making it hard for me to focus on work this Monday ><
