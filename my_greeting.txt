Love you so much<3
Happy Saturday! Let’s leave all the worries of February behind and make today all about love and laughter. I hope your weekend is as wonderful and relaxing as you are to me.
I have found the one whom my soul loves.
To be fully seen by somebody, then, and be loved anyhow—this is a human offering that can border on miraculous.
Love is a friendship set to music.
Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.
