Happy meeting day! See you at 8.30 <3
Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory.
Appreciate what you have before it turns into what you had.
The most precious gift we can offer anyone is our attention. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.
Treat them like you are still trying to win them, and you will never lose them.
The trouble is, you think you have time.
