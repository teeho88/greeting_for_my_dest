Love you! Miss you so much<3
Happy Wednesday! We’re halfway through the week, and you’re still 100% of my thoughts. Keep pushing forward, my love; I'm always here cheering for you!
Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own.
You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.
Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it.
If I had a flower for every time I thought of you... I could walk through my garden forever.
