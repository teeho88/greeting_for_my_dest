Love you! Miss you so much<3
Happy Sunday, my love! I hope today brings you the rest you need and the joy you deserve. Let's make every second of this lazy day count together.
Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it meaning.
In case you ever foolishly forget: I am never not thinking of you.
The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.
Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused.
