Love you! Miss you so much<3
Happy Monday, my love! Let’s start this week with a heart full of dreams and a soul full of love. Remember that no matter how busy the day gets, you’re always my first and most beautiful thought.
Love is not about how many days, months, or years you have been together. Love is about how much you love each other every single day.
He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same.
Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.
Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be.
