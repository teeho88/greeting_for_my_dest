Love you! Forgive me, please!
Happy Friday! Finish your day strong, my love.
If I could give you one thing in life, I would give you the ability to see yourself through my eyes, only then would you realize how special you are to me.
In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In all the world, there is no love for you like mine.
Love heals when time cannot.
Home is not a place, it's a person. And I am finally home.
