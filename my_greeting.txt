Happy Sunday! Have a gooday<3
I choose you. And I'll choose you over and over. Without pause, without a doubt, in a heartbeat. I'll keep choosing you.
You are my favorite thought to wake up to and my favorite dream to sleep with. Good day, my love.
I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you.
My life is so much better with you in it. Thank you for being my peace and my joy
No matter what this week brings, remember that my heart is, and always will be, yours.
