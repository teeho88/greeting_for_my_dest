I’m really sorry for not telling you earlier. I was busy and didn’t mean to make you worry.
I’m sorry I didn’t text you. I got caught up with work and couldn't let you know.
Please forgive me for not checking in. I know it made you feel bad.
I’m sorry for the silence. You were always on my mind, even when I couldn’t reply.
I didn’t mean to disappear. I was busy, but I should have sent at least one message.
I’m sorry for making you feel unimportant. That was never my intention.
