Love you! Miss you so much<3
Happy Thursday! The weekend is almost here, but my love for you is already in full bloom. May your day be light, your heart be happy, and your tasks feel effortless. Can't wait to see you!
Love is not something you find. Love is something that finds you.
The giving of love is an education in itself.
Your heart and my heart are very old friends.
Wherever you are is my home, my only home.
