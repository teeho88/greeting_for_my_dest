Love you so much<3
Happy Sunday and Happy March! May this new month bring you endless joy and new reasons to smile. Let’s spend today resting, loving, and preparing our hearts for all the beautiful things ahead.
Love is being stupid together.
In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In all the world, there is no love for you like mine.
I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more.
If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you.
