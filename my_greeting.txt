Happy happy happy! Happy happy happy happy<3
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.
Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.
In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In all the world, there is no love for you like mine.
You are my heart, my life, my one and only thought.
May we always have each other <3
